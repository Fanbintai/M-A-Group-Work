Please pick one M&A transaction either **ANNOUNCED or COMPLETED in 2016-17**, involving at least one public listed company in Asia.  Let me know once you have confirmed with your choice.  I will re-confirm with you to avoid duplication in other groups.

**Case Study Report**

As an integral component of this course, each team will have to select a real-world M&A case for detailed analysis and write-up. The format of the report could follow Professor Larry LANG’s casebook, which serves as a minimum benchmark. The valuation of the target firm will form the core part of the analysis. For a better grade, you need to identify interesting and critical issues related to your case and elaborate on these in greater detail.

Please write a discussion report regarding both topics as follow. The length of the report should not exceed 10 pages (double-spaced A4 pages), excluding references and appendices (if any). The report should be submitted in the class of **Week 6.**
## Topic 1: Quarterly Financial Reporting
According to the HKEX’s listing rules, quarterly financial reporting is voluntary for the companies listed on the main board, while it is mandatory for those listed on the GEM (Growth Enterprise Market). What do you think about the issue on the reporting frequency of financial information?

## Topic 2: Ethics in Financial Reporting
Discuss the ethical issues involved, based on the following information.

Joe is the chief financial officer for Withco Ltd responsible for negotiating bank loans.  

It has been the practice to obtain loans from a number of merchant banks.

He has recently met Ben who had been on the same undergraduate course some years earlier. 

They agree to meet for a game of squash and during the course of the evening Joe learns that Ben is the chief loans officer at The Swift Merchant Bank. 

During the next five years Joe negotiates all of the company’s loan requirements through Swift, and Ben arranges for Joe to receive substantial allocations in initial public offerings. 

Over that period Joe has done quite well out of taking up allocations and selling them within a few days on the market.

Please pick one M&A transaction either **ANNOUNCED or COMPLETED in 2016-17**, involving at least one public listed company in Asia.  Let me know once you have confirmed with your choice.  I will re-confirm with you to avoid duplication in other groups.

**Case Study Report**

As an integral component of this course, each team will have to select a real-world M&A case for detailed analysis and write-up. The format of the report could follow Professor Larry LANG’s casebook, which serves as a minimum benchmark. The valuation of the target firm will form the core part of the analysis. For a better grade, you need to identify interesting and critical issues related to your case and elaborate on these in greater detail.
